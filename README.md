üîß **How It Works**

Aptos Sentinel AI operates as a sophisticated, multi-layered intelligence system, working seamlessly in the background to protect and inform.

**1. Real-Time Monitoring & Data Intelligence Pipeline:**
The journey begins with relentless data acquisition. Aptos Sentinel AI continuously pulls **live blockchain data** directly from the Aptos mainnet via official Node APIs, capturing every transaction, gas price fluctuation, and smart contract interaction. Simultaneously, it taps into the vast historical archives of **Google Cloud BigQuery**, processing immense datasets of past transaction patterns and network metrics. This dual stream of real-time and historical data feeds into the AI's core.

**2. Intelligent Analysis & Predictive Forecasting:**
Once data is ingested, the intelligence layers activate:
* **AI Processing (Gemini AI):** Gemini AI scrutinizes the incoming data streams, identifying complex patterns, detecting subtle irregularities, and interpreting blockchain events. This powerful AI engine also drives the conversational assistant, allowing users to query blockchain state and anomalies in natural language.
* **Predictive Analytics (Allora Network):** Allora Network's decentralized AI-powered oracle takes the real-time data to the next level by generating **predictive forecasts**. It anticipates future market movements (e.g., ETH/BTC price predictions) and, crucially for Aptos Sentinel AI, can be trained to predict potential network stress or unusual resource consumption based on current patterns. This foresight is key to proactive alerts.

**3. Secure Computation & Anomaly Detection:**
When potential anomalies or security-sensitive analyses are required, **Marlin Protocol's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** comes into play. Sensitive analysis logic (e.g., detailed security scoring, precise threat assessment) is executed within these tamper-proof, confidential VMs. This ensures that the AI's most critical decision-making processes remain private and verifiable, providing an uncompromised foundation for security recommendations. Detected anomalies, categorized by severity, are then presented to the user.

**4. Autonomous Actions & Wallet-Gated Control:**
The culmination of this pipeline is the ability for the AI agent to take action.
* **Rule-Based Execution:** The AI operates based on **predefined rules and responses** configured in the "Agent Governance" section (managed via ElizaOS). If a high-severity threat is confirmed (potentially after TEE analysis), the AI agent, deployed as a Move module on Aptos, can **automatically initiate on-chain actions.**
* **User Empowerment:** For critical actions like temporarily pausing a smart contract or blacklisting suspicious addresses, the platform prepares the transaction and routes it to the **user's connected OKX Wallet for secure confirmation and digital signature.** This "wallet-gated access control" ensures the user retains ultimate authority over their assets and maintains a non-custodial environment. For less critical alerts, the agent might simply log the event or trigger an off-chain notification.
* **Real-time Balance Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors the user's connected wallet balance, providing insights and even intelligent recommendations based on detected anomalies.
